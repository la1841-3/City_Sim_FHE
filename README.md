# City Sim FHE: A Privacy-Powered City Builder üèôÔ∏èüîí

City Sim FHE is an innovative city-building simulation game powered by **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology**. In this game, players step into the shoes of a mayor, designing and implementing complex economic policies‚Äîsuch as taxation and trade‚Äîwhile keeping their strategies confidential. The opposing cities can only analyze your urban development to infer your tactics, making every decision a strategic dance of secrecy and competition.

## The Challenge of Transparency üìâ

In today‚Äôs digital landscape, the challenge of maintaining privacy while engaging in economic activities is significant. City-building games often require players to share strategies and policies openly, exposing them to competition and espionage. This lack of confidentiality can lead to a frustrating gaming experience where players must constantly worry about their strategies being stolen instead of enjoying the creative aspects of city management.

## How FHE Transforms Gameplay üîç‚ú®

City Sim FHE addresses these privacy concerns by utilizing **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption**. Our implementation leverages Zama‚Äôs open-source libraries, including **Concrete** and **zama-fhe SDK**, to encrypt economic policies while allowing for computations on encrypted data. This means players can confidently create and execute strategies, knowing that their decisions remain private, even from other players. The game introduces a new layer of depth to strategy and competition, allowing for immersive gameplay without the fear of information leaks.

## Core Features üéÆüåÜ

- **Encrypted Economic Policies**: Players can design tax and trade policies that are secured using FHE, protecting their strategies from prying eyes.
- **Happiness and Revenue Calculation**: The game utilizes homomorphic encryption to calculate citizens' happiness and city revenue without revealing sensitive data.
- **Economic Competition and Espionage**: Engage in a simulated environment where cities compete economically, and players can spy on others while maintaining the confidentiality of their strategies.
- **Dynamic Sandbox Environment**: Craft policies and build your city while navigating through a sandbox-like interface that encourages creativity and strategic thinking.

## Technology Stack üõ†Ô∏è

- **Language**: Solidity
- **Framework**: Hardhat
- **Zama SDK**: Concrete, TFHE-rs, and zama-fhe SDK
- **Frontend**: React
- **Database**: IPFS for storing city data

## Example Code Snippet üìù

Here is a simple code example that demonstrates how to create an encrypted economic policy in City Sim FHE:

```solidity
// City_Sim_FHE.sol
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "zama-fhe-sdk/contracts/FHEPolicy.sol";

contract City_Sim_FHE {
    mapping(address => FHEPolicy) public policies;

    function createEconomicPolicy(uint256 taxRate) public {
        // Encrypting the taxRate and storing it in the player's policy
        policies[msg.sender] = createFHEPolicy(taxRate);
    }

    function createFHEPolicy(uint256 rate) internal pure returns (FHEPolicy) {
        return FHEPolicy(rate);
    }
}
```

This example shows how players can create and store encrypted economic policies using the **FHEPolicy** contract from Zama's SDK.
